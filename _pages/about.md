Linli Zhou is an Institutional Research Analyst at Lasell University, holding a Ph.D. in Social Science and Comparative Education from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Her expertise spans mixed-methods research, data visualization, data visualization, R and Python programming, with a focus on student success, program evaluation, and institutional strategy in higher education.

Driven by a deep passion for data research, Linli eagerly explores innovative ways to automate data reporting and review, design accessible data visualizations, and integrate cutting-edge data modeling techniques into analytics. Her ultimate goal is to empower higher education professionals to support student success more effectively.

Beyond her role as a skilled and passionate researcher, Linli is also an educator adept at teaching and sharing research methodology. She leads professional development initiatives for the institutional research (IR) community, serving as the elected Member-at-Large for the Overseas Chinese Association of Institutional Research (OCAIR) and on the conference planning committee for the North East Association of Institutional Research (NEAIR). Linli was honored with [the inaugural "Rising Star Award" from the Association of Institutional Research (AIR)](https://www.airweb.org/resources/awards-scholarships/awards/Rising-Star) in 2024.

Linli's recent portfolio showcases a wide array of accomplishments, including:

- **Predictive Analytics**: Building data models to enhance supportive interventions for student success across academic, social, and career outcomes, as well as improving institutional effectiveness in areas such as enrollment, retention, and graduation rates.

- **Data Management and Visualization**: Cultivating a culture of data quality assurance by implementing best practices for ensuring data cleanliness, enhancing efficiency and consistency through coding in SQL, R, and Python, and presenting data through compelling visualizations.

- **Survey and Mixed-Methods Research**: Collaborating with offices and service providers to develop surveys and focus groups that address their improvement needs. This includes assessing student needs and evaluating interventions and high-impact practices.
  
- **Program Assessment and Policy Evaluation**: Evaluating policies (e.g., financial aid strategies) and reviewing programs at various levels—including students, faculty, courses, and services—to optimize resource allocation, budgeting, and planning.
  
<!--- - **University Strategic Planning:** Analyzing faculty([dashboard](https://ym205k-linli.shinyapps.io/FacultyTenureAnalysis/)) workload and performance, strategically discontinuing or launching programs, and studying student flows.-->

<!--- **Federal Reporting and Board of Trustees' Overview KPIs:** Conducting historical analysis and regression modeling for student admissions, enrollment, financial aid, retention, completion, satisfaction, and career outcomes.-->
  
- **Strategic Planning**: Identifying opportunities for institutional effectiveness and policy enhancement through market research. This includes comparing trends and outcomes of peer institutions using national databases (e.g., National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS, NSSE, National Student Clearinghouse) and web-scraped data.
